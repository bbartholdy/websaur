We grow oral multispecies biofilms on plastic pegs, which are inoculated with whole saliva and suspended in artificial saliva for 25 days. The mineral composition of the in vitro calculus was verified using FTIR spectroscopy and archaeological and modern reference calculus.\nThe biofilms were submerged in solutions (0.5% w/v) containing wheat and potato starches twice daily for six minutes. Over the course of the experiment the biofilms were exposed to a large quantity of wheat (ca. $45.43×10^6$) and potato (ca. $3.583×10^6$) starch grains, of which only a minor proportion was visible, microscopically, in thecalculus (0.0021% and 0.0018%, respectively). The proportion of small (\u0026lt;20 µm) grains recovered from the calculus for both wheat (0.0034%) and potato (0.0032%), was greater than for large (\u0026gt;20 µm) grains (0.0003% and 0.0007%, respectively). These results suggest that only a minor portion of an individual’s diet is retained in the dental calculus and that there is a size bias in the incorporation of starches, such that larger grains may be underrepresented.\nThis model calculus system can provide the framework to perform controlled experiments addressing fundamental questions and issues concerning dental calculus, which have yet to be explored. These include validation of sampling and extraction methods, the incorporation of dietary and other markers into the calculus matrix, and the effects of taphonomy.\nThis project was funded by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [grant number STG–677576 (“HARVEST”)].\n","date":1587051900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1587051900,"objectID":"cbf1d2573dbbb1402ccfa87229ecd715","permalink":"/talk/aapa2020/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/aapa2020/","section":"talk","summary":"Introducing a model dental calculus system.","tags":[],"title":"Build-a-Calculus","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"HARVEST Project Plant foods comprise the majority of most human diets, yet the potential importance of these foods in human evolution is often overlooked. Using a behavioral ecology framework, the HARVEST project explores fundamental questions: Why did hominins choose to eat certain plants? What were their foraging goals?\nDental Calculus To understand the factors driving food choice by ancient hominins, we must know what they ate. Analyses of plant remains and other residues preserved in dental calculus provide information about food and processing techniques. We are using these methods to explore the diets of various hominin groups, both recent and ancient.\nPlant Nutritional Variation The decision to consume a particular plant depends in part on its inherent properties (nutrients and antifeedants). We are exploring the variation in plant properties among microhabitats in African environments similar to those used by hominins, to better model their food choices.\nFactors Influencing Food Choices Cultural and technological factors also influence food choice. We are working with the Baka and Nzime of southeastern Cameroon to understand how they value wild plant foods, and to explore the relative influences of food quality, food accessibility, cultural preferences, and integration within the market economy on their dietary patterns.\nCosts of Food Processing: Finally, we are examining the energetic costs of food processing, such from chewing refractive foods or from gathering fuel for cooking food, might influence food choices.\nResults from these studies will help fill important lacunae in our understanding of hominin diets, broaden our knowledge of hominin behaviors in a variety of environments, and help generate hypotheses about the relationships between diet and human evolution.\nFunding statement: This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant agreement No. STG-677576), awarded to Amanda G.

Starch grains are found in many food products and can become entrapped in dental calculus. This allows researchers to recover information about the food that was consumed in the past, as the starch grains can often be identified as elements of wheat, oat, barley, etc. However, we know little about how starch grains end up in calculus, and how much of the dietary behaviour of an individual in the past is actually encapsulated within the ancient dental calculus\nThe purpose of the experiment is to mimic archaeological conditions and determine how well starch grains survive in the soil when protected by calculus, and how much dietary information will be lost over time. Artificial dental calculus will be grown in the lab and “fed” with solutions containing potato and wheat starches twice daily for three weeks. The calculus will then be buried for periods of 3, 9, and 18 months, to document what happens to the starch grains within the calculus when they are in the ground. Once the samples have been excavated, they will be dissolved in a weak acid and analysed under a microscope to determine the quantity of starch grains remaining in each sample. The samples will be compared to control samples that are not buried, and will give some indication of the degradation of starch grains over time.\n28-06-2019: Day 0 The first day of the experiment was spent spitting in a tube (for science!). Saliva donations were generously provided by the wonderful volunteers, which will be the inoculum. This is the most important step of the experiment, as it provides the proteins and bacteria that are essential for the initial growth of calculus. A plastic substitute for real teeth is submerged in the donated saliva, which will provide the pellicle and bacteria necessary to initiate the growth of calculus. The pellicle is a film of proteins that covers the teeth and allows bacteria to attach. After four hours, the “teeth” are transferred from the donated saliva to artificial saliva. It would be difficult to continuously provide fresh saliva for the duration of the experiment; the artificial saliva, which contains pig’s mucous and minerals present in real saliva, allows the volunteers to take a break and rehydrate.\n  The volunteers knew what they were getting into\u0026hellip;   Fun fact (admittedly loose definition of ‘fun’): The dental pellicle (re)forms on our teeth shortly after brushing. It protects our teeth from damage caused by eating and tooth-on-tooth contact; however, it also allows bacteria to attach to our teeth, and some of them are evil. So, remember to brush every day (but not too often)!\n  The substitute-teeth   01-07-2019: Day 3 The second day of saliva donations. The “teeth” are once again submerged in fresh saliva to provide more of the necessary proteins and bacteria for biofilm formation (in case it didn’t take the first time).\n  Not much to see in the early stages. The invisible-to-the-naked-eye pellicle and bacteria are (hopefully) attached to the \u0026lsquo;teeth\u0026rsquo;   Fun fact: Saliva is a very important part of the oral environment. It consists mainly of water (ca. 99%), but also contains essential proteins and enzymes. It keeps the oral environment from becoming too acidic, and removes food particles from the teeth. Prolonged exposure to an acidic environment can cause tooth decay.\n  A rare sighting of the evasive PhD student in his natural habitat   03-07-2019: Day 5 The last day of saliva donations, just to make extra sure that the necessary components are present and that the right type of bacteria are allowed to grow. This is the final day of inoculation, after which the bacteria will be (somewhat) left to their own devices. The only intervention is feeding them starch and sugar twice daily (like a low maintenance pet).\nFun fact: Another role of saliva is lubrication. When you start chewing on your food, the salivary glands in your mouth start producing saliva at a higher rate than normal. This helps you to swallow your food. Also thinking about food will increase the production of saliva; so, if you start drooling when you think about your favourite meal, it is completely normal!\n  The samples are kept in an incubator, which maintains the surrounding temperature at a constant 36 degrees celsius (similar to the inside of your mouth)   08-07-2019: Day 10 Some growth is now visible on the “teeth”. The layer of gunk is dental plaque, an oral biofilm comprised mainly of lots and lots of bacteria (yum!). This is what forms on your teeth if you don’t brush frequently. While mostly harmless and easy to remove, it can develop into the more harmful cavities and calculus.\n  Some plaque is now visible   Fun fact: But wait, there’s more! Saliva also serves as the initial step in the digestion of food. The enzyme alpha-amylase can break down the starches in our food and transform them into smaller sugars which are easier for us to digest.\n##13-07-2019: Day 15\nBecause dental plaque takes a long time to mineralise and develop into calculus (can be days to weeks to months), mineralisation is encouraged by feeding the plaque with a high-mineral diet for the remainder of the experiment. Dental calculus mainly consists of calcium and phosphate and different variants of these, such as hydroxyapatite, brushite, and octacalcium phosphate.\n  Dental calculus on the incisors and molars of an archaeological mandible   Fun fact: Because dental calculus is a very tough material (hydroxyapatite is also the main mineral in bone), if you have a large amount of it on your teeth it can actually protect your teeth from wearing down. However, this is not a recommended tactic since dental calculus can harbour a lot of evil bacteria and potentially cause gum disease.\n17-07-2019 Day 19 Remember the previous fact about starch and amylase? This means that if there is any amylase present during the experiment, it could potentially interfere with the interpretations about the burial environment. Therefore, samples of the artificial saliva were taken to test whether amylase is present and, if so, how much.\n  This image shows how amylase (the pacman-like objects) can break down starch (the spirals) into more manageable sugars, and how the bacteria (the large sun-like object in the corner) can use the amylase to acquire the sugars for themselves. Image url: https://aem.asm.org/content/79/2/416.   23-07-2019 Day 25 The final day of growth. The fully-formed calculus is ready to be buried for the next part of the experiment.\n  Yes, this smells as disgusting as it looks\u0026hellip;   Fun fact: Calculus originally referred to (and is still mainly used for) a branch of mathematics and means “small pebble (or stone)” in Latin; small pebbles were often used as the original calculator (the older generation may also remember the abacus). It was not until the 18th century it was used to refer to mineral build-ups occurring in the body, including the kidney and teeth. In fact, many languages still refer to dental calculus as “tooth stone”.\n24-07-2019 Burial\n  The four posts mark the area where the samples were buried.   Burial of the samples was conducted in the beautiful Vlaardingen Broekpolder near a reconstruction of a Neolithic house. This was done on one of the hottest days of the summer(!!). Three holes were made for the three burial times. In each hole was placed duplicates of the starch-containing calculus samples and duplicates of the control samples. This also concludes the initial part of the experiment.\nAnd now we wait…\n  The samples were buried in potato sacks so they would be easier to find   link to original post: https://leidenarchaeologyblog.nl/articles/spit-tartar-and-burial-an-experiments-diary\n","date":1568246400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568246400,"objectID":"75b01aea7960532c9365226a8e2a6153","permalink":"/post/spit/","publishdate":"2019-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/spit/","section":"post","summary":"A blog post involving the growth of artificial dental calculus/tartar.","tags":null,"title":"Spit, Tartar, and Burial","type":"post"},{"authors":["Bartholdy, B.P.","Hoogland, M.L.P","Waters-Rist, A."],"categories":null,"content":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oa.2758\n","date":1554768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554768000,"objectID":"7e88e81c840b43ffbf5aea943145a124","permalink":"/publication/how-old-are-you-now/","publishdate":"2019-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/how-old-are-you-now/","section":"publication","summary":"Non-adult age-at-death estimation using dental wear of the deciduous and permanent dentition.","tags":"","title":"How old are you now?

Henry"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract In recent years, analysis of dental calculus has experienced a surge in popularity due to its ability to store and preserve markers of past diet. However, little is known about the processes by which these markers are incorporated into the dental calculus, and to what extent the data obtained by various methods (e.g. aDNA analysis, palaeoproteomics, and microscopy) are an accurate depiction of past diets and behaviours; if they have unidentified sources of bias causing that would cause under- and overrepresentation of some markers, or others to be missed entirely. The primary objective of this study was to develop a protocol for a model calculus system that can provide a means of testing the accuracy of current methods used for the extraction and analysis of dietary markers, and address future questions pertaining to dietary research on dental calculus. Dental plaque was grown for 10 days based on the ACTA active attachment (AAA) biofilm model, and then mineralised for 10 days using a calcium-phosphate-monofluorophosphate-urea (CPMU) solution. Known quantities of starches were added to the calculus during daily \u0026ldquo;feedings\u0026rdquo;. These were assessed to evaluate the extent of incorporation of starches in the dental calculus, the efficiency of extraction protocols, and the accuracy of microscopic analysis of starch quantities. Multiple replicates of dental calculus samples were successfully grown, each containing ca. 12 mg of calculus, demonstrating the efficacy of this method for creating a model calculus system. As expected, the overall number and ratio of starches decreased over the course of extraction, dissolution in EDTA and/or HCl, and analysis by microscopy. The dietary image depicted by the final starch quantities was inconsistent with the quantity and ratio of starch that was originally \u0026ldquo;fed\u0026rdquo; to the calculus. There remains a lot to learn about the incorporation of dietary markers in calculus, both ante-mortem and post-mortem, and the biases of various analytical methods. The in vitro model calculus system presented here provides a controlled environment for assessing the loss of calculus due to potentially biased sampling and analysis methods, contributing valuable information to facilitate the most efficient methodological approaches to future research questions on diet and dental calculus.\n","date":1537540200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537540200,"objectID":"0ab39c1fd6117aecc135970b53088c58","permalink":"/talk/isba2018/","publishdate":"2018-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/isba2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Introducing a model dental calculus system to test fundamental aspects of dental calculus research.","tags":[],"title":"Back to basics","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Bartholdy, BP","Murchie, TJ","Hacking, K","Verwoerd, C"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"2a37dade341021ad401d29176560e62c","permalink":"/publication/dog-days/","publishdate":"2019-04-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dog-days/","section":"publication","summary":"A preliminary aDNA analysis of canid bones from southern Alberta and Saskatchewan.","tags":"","title":"Dog Days on the Plains.
