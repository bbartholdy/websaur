I am currently a PhD student working on Dr. Amanda Henry’s ERC-funded HARVEST project, which aims to further our understanding of food choice in human evolution. I am exploring the incorporation of food residues in dental calculus by examining their behaviour in a controlled lab setting using in vitro oral biofilm models, and aim to maximise the recovered dietary information from archaeological dental calculus.

I obtained my BSc in Archaeology (with a concentration in biological anthropology) at the University of Calgary. My thesis explored the utility of micro-CT on osteoarthritic vertebrae, under the guidance of Dr. Mary Anne Katzenberg.

I obtained my MSc in Human Osteoarchaeology at Leiden University. Here, I used micro-CT to study the enamel properties of deciduous canines and molars in relation to dental pathology, supervised by Dr. Andrea Waters-Rist.

My other research interests include anything to do with teeth, including dental non-metrics. My academic background is quite scattered and includes maths, biology, and archaeology, but mostly osteoarchaeology.
