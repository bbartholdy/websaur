I am currently a PhD student working on Dr. Amanda Henry’s ERC-funded [HARVEST](http://harvestproject.eu/) project, which aims to further our understanding of food choice in human evolution. I am exploring the incorporation of food residues in dental calculus by examining their behaviour in a controlled lab setting using in vitro oral biofilm models, and aim to maximise the recovered dietary information from archaeological dental calculus.
