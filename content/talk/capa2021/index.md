## Abstract

Dental calculus, mineralised dental plaque, has proven to contain a wealth of dietary information in the form of plant microfossils, including starch granules from a dietary origin. Until recently, limited validation has been conducted on the incorporation bias of microfossils in the dental calculus, and these have been limited to studies on modern humans and non-human primates.  
Here, we present a model calculus system, which allows experimental research to be conducted on *in vitro* dental calculus in a controlled laboratory setting. We have grown oral multispecies biofilms, inoculated with whole saliva, and exposed them to common dietary starches (wheat, potato, and a mix of both), over the course of 25 days. The model calculus was dissolved in EDTA, and starch granules were counted under a microscope. Granule counts recovered from the calculus represented a very low proportion (0.064% to 0.161%) of the total granules that were exposed to the model calculus. Additionally, the size ratios of granules within starch species shifted between the input starch solutions and the granules extracted from the model calculus, with large granules (>20 $\mu$m) consistently being underrepresented. These results suggest that the picture of an individual's diet as presented by dental calculus may be biased towards plant species producing small starches (<20 $\mu$m).
