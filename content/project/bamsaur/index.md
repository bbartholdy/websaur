BAMSAUR is an R-package that contains functions for estimating nonadult age-at-death based on dental wear. Age-at-death can be estimated based on the built-in reference sample (Middenbeemster), or a different sample which can be uploaded by the user. The goal is to expand the number of built-in reference samples available to the user, thereby allowing the user to choose the most appropriate reference sample (temporally, geographically, etc.) for age-at-death estimation.
